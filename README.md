# Case Study: How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?

## Three questions will guide the future marketing program:
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

## I will produce a report with the following deliverables:
1. A clear statement of the business task.
2. A description of all data sources used.
3. Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data.
4. A summary of my analysis.
5. Supporting visualizations and key findings.
6. My top three recommendations based on my analysis.
